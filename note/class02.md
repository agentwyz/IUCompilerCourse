in the interpreter

we use the widget of `read`ã€‚

the `read` widget only get the number form the input

when the inpterpreter get the `int` return a `int` value, the same behavior as complier

so this is a intersting thing

if the interpreter get a error, but the complier are runing, it so bad

so you complier should give some infomation
